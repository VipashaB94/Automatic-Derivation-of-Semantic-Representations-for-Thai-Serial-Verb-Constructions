# Automatic Derivation of Semantic Representations for Thai Serial Verb Constructions: A Grammar-Based Approach

This is the computational Thai grammar accompanying this paper which will be presented at the ACL 2024 Student Research Workshop.

## Abstract:

Deep semantic representations are useful for many NLU tasks (Droganova and Zeman, 2019; Schuster and Manning, 2016). Manual annotation to build these representations is time-consuming, and so automatic approaches are preferred (Droganova and Zeman, 2019; Bender et al. 2015). This paper demonstrates how rich semantic representations can be automatically derived for Thai Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs), where the semantic relationship between component verbs is not immediately clear from the surface forms. I present the first fully-implemented, unified analysis for Thai SVCs, deriving appropriate semantic representations (MRS; Copestake et al. 2005) from syntactic features, implemented within a DELPH-IN computational grammar (Slayden 2009). This analysis increases verified coverage of SVCs by 73% and decreases ambiguity by 46%.
